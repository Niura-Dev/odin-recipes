    <h2>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Servings: 1</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 or 3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of milk</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon of butter or oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Optional: shredded cheese, chopped chives, ham, or any other ingredient you like.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>1. Crack the eggs: In a medium bowl, crack the eggs.</li>
        <li>2. Whisk the eggs: Add the milk or cream, salt, and pepper. Whisk vigorously with a fork or a balloon whisk
            until the whites and yolks are well combined and the mixture has a uniform color. The milk or cream helps
            them become fluffier.</li>
        <li>3. Heat the pan: Place a non-stick pan over medium heat. Add the butter or oil and let it melt to coat the
            bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>4. Cook the eggs: Pour the egg mixture into the hot pan. Let it cook for about 30 seconds without moving it,
            until the edges start to set.</li>
        <li>5. Scramble gently: With a rubber or silicone spatula, gently push the eggs from the edges toward the center
            of the pan. Repeat this motion slowly, allowing the liquid part to flow into the empty spaces.</li>
        <li>6. Serve immediately: Once the eggs are almost completely set but still a little moist (this prevents them
            from getting dry), remove them from the heat. The residual heat will finish cooking them. If you're going to
            add cheese, this is the time to sprinkle it on.</li>
    </ol>
