# odin-recipes

Project Description
This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum. It is a basic recipe website built using HTML to demonstrate the fundamental skills of a web developer. The site includes a main index page with links to several recipes.

Demonstrated Skills
Through the creation of this project, I have demonstrated my ability to:

Set up a Git and GitHub Repository: I successfully cloned a repository from GitHub to my local machine and managed the standard workflow using git add, git commit, and git push.

Write Basic HTML Code: I created the structure for several web pages using HTML tags for headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and links.

Organize a Web Project: I structured the project files logically, keeping the code and assets in separate directories for better organization.

Use Relative Links: I connected the different pages of the website using relative file paths, which is essential for navigation within a project.
